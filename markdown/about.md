I recently graduated with a degree in Computer Science at [UNC](https://cs.unc.edu/). I am passionate about building quality products with software and love to hack on projects with open source technologies in my spare time. You can check out some of my previous [projects](https://dongyeop.com/projects/), which range from CLIs to chatbots and web applications. If you find any errors in my posts or just want to reach out, feel free to contact [me](mailto:dongy7@gmail.com).
