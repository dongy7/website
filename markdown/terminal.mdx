Code snippets can help present information like commands for a user to enter but can feel static
and sometimes overwhelming if there is too much text. Also snippets lack a way to show what should
happen when something is executed without showing everything at once.

React animated terminal is a component that enables rendering of a terminal with fine grain control
over the timing of the output. Here is an example of a basic command being executed with a frame based
output. As you can see, an animated terminal can provide a view that is like an actual live terminal
without having to capture the screen to create a gif.

<div style={{ marginTop: '50px', marginBottom: '25px' }}>
<Terminal />
</div>

React animated terminal is published on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-animated-term) and can
be used with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and any module bundlers like [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).
